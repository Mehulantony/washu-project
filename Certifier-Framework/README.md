***Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing***

**Overview**

The Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing is an open-source framework designed to enable secure and verifiable computation in untrusted environments. It provides tools for attestation, policy enforcement, and data protection, ensuring that computations are executed within trusted hardware enclaves, such as Intel SGX, AMD SEV, and other Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).
