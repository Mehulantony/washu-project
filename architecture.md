# Government Financial Budget Assistant - Architecture Design

## Overview

The Government Financial Budget Assistant is designed to allow government finance officers and analysts to query U.S. government budget data using natural language. The system leverages the Gemini LLM and follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture to process queries and provide detailed budget insights.

## Architecture Components

The system consists of three main components:

1. **MCP Client**: The frontend interface that users interact with to submit queries and view results
2. **Gemini API Client**: The middleware that processes natural language queries using Gemini LLM
3. **MCP Server**: The backend that retrieves and processes budget data from various sources

## Detailed Component Specifications

### 1. MCP Client

The MCP Client serves as the user interface for the Government Financial Budget Assistant.

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide a user-friendly interface for submitting natural language queries
- Display query results in an informative and visually appealing manner
- Handle user authentication and session management
- Maintain query history for users

**Technologies:**
- Frontend Framework: React.js
- State Management: Redux
- Data Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js
- API Communication: Axios

### 2. Gemini API Client

The Gemini API Client serves as the middleware that processes natural language queries using Google's Gemini LLM.

**Responsibilities:**
- Authenticate with the Gemini API
- Process natural language queries to extract structured parameters
- Convert unstructured queries into structured data requests
- Format responses for the MCP Client

**Technologies:**
- Language: Python
- Gemini API Integration: Google AI Python SDK
- Parameter Extraction: Custom prompt engineering
- API Framework: FastAPI

### 3. MCP Server

The MCP Server handles data retrieval and processing from various U.S. government budget data sources.

**Responsibilities:**
- Connect to and query government budget data sources
- Process and filter data based on extracted parameters
- Perform data aggregation and analysis
- Cache frequently requested data for improved performance

**Technologies:**
- Language: Python
- Web Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL for caching
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

## Data Flow

1. **Query Submission**:
   - User submits a natural language query through the MCP Client
   - Example: "What was the Department of Defense spending in fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022?"

2. **Query Processing**:
   - The query is sent to the Gemini API Client
   - Gemini LLM extracts structured parameters from the query:
     - Entity: Department of Defense
     - Metric: Spending
     - Time Periods: FY 2023, FY 2022
     - Analysis Type: Comparison

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The MCP Server receives the structured parameters
   - It queries the appropriate data sources (e.g., USASpending.gov API)
   - The data is filtered and processed according to the parameters

4. **Response Generation**:
   - The MCP Server formats the processed data
   - The Gemini API Client enhances the response with natural language insights
   - The MCP Client displays the results with appropriate visualizations

## Budget Data Sources

The system will integrate with the following U.S. government budget data sources:

1. **USASpending.gov API**:
   - Provides detailed federal spending data
   - Offers information on contracts, grants, loans, and other financial assistance

2. **Treasury.gov APIs**:
   - Provides data on federal debt, revenue, and spending
   - Includes fiscal service data APIs

3. **Data.gov Budget APIs**:
   - Offers various budget-related datasets
   - Provides historical budget data

4. **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**:
   - Provides economic indicators related to government spending
   - Offers historical context for budget analysis

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
   - Role-based access control for different user types

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Implement proper data handling procedures

3. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - API key management for external services

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Design components to be stateless for easy scaling
   - Implement load balancing for the MCP Server

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache frequent queries and responses
   - Implement data refresh policies

3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Use message queues for handling complex queries
   - Implement background processing for data updates
